         <h5>Accomplishments</h5>
         <ul>
          <li>Led event summarization team focused on text-generation for social media posts about public saftey events using seq2seq LSTM and Transformer models. These models drastically decreased time it took for editors to write event summaries. </li>
          <li>Created a front-end interface to enable a user-study to better understand how event-summary editors interact with text-generation models, allowing for effective deployment of a human-in-the-loop system.</li>
          <li>Led geo-prediction team, which can detect mentions of addresses in text and geocode them to points on the earth. Trained and deployed a neural-network-CRF model to detect address mentions in conjuction with LambdaRank model to rank predictions. The resulting models led to large speed increases in geo-prediction, as well as large increase in precision of geo-predictions.</li>
          <li>Led automation team, combining multiple different models in a pipeline for full automation in collaboration with product and engineering teams. This project resulted in the full automation of in the majority of alerts sent by Dataminr as well as increased the number of alerts sent out by Dataminr by 70%.  </li>
          <li>Created a new language-identification model for social media with support for 80 languages which can detect use of multiple languages in one tweet/sentence using structured SVM model. Additionally, a novel version of sparse viterbi was created to increase prediction speeds.</li>
          <li>Built, improved, and maintained a novel neural-network library written in Scala. </li>
          <li>Created a English named entity recognition (NER) model for twitter data using a neural-network-CRF. This model achieved around 76 f1 on general English tweets with 84 f1 for tweets that are most interesting to the company.</li>
          <li>Built a social-media topic classification model using a fully conncted neural-network with custom trained word2wec on billions of tweets which improved on the previously implemented method by over 20 F1 points.</li> 
          <li>Started and ran a data-science reading group.</li>
          <li>Mentored multiple intern groups, leading to successful publications for interns in top workshops and conferences.</li>
        </ul>

         <h5>Accomplishments</h5>
         <ul>
          <li>Investigated methods for highly parallel probabilistic inference on conditional random
          fields (CRFs) using Nvida GPUs.</li>
          
          <li>Created a GPU version of the belief propagation algorithm written in CUDA. I’ve optimized this implementation to allow for 200x speedup in inference and 100x speedup in training of CRFs over sequential implementation.</li>
